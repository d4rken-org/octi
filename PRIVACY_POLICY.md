# Privacy policy

This is the privacy policy for the Android app "Permission Pilot".

## Preamble

Permission Pilot respects your privacy.

I do not collect, share or sell personal information.

Send a [quick mail](mailto:support@darken.eu) if you have questions.

My underlying privacy principle is the [Golden Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule).

"Permission Pilot" neither collects nor allows 3rd party services to collect any user data. Not even anonymously.

## Sync services

Octi provides different mechanisms to syncronize data across different devices. The following explains the different
mechanisms and how your data is handled.

### J-Server

J-Server is an end to end encrypted open-source sync server hosted by me.

No synced data can be viewed by me. Data is encrypted client-side. The encryption key is only available on your device.

Some meta data like access times and IP addresses are temporarily stored to allow for anti-abuse mechanisms.

Any stored data can be deleted from within the app by deleting your account. If your account is not accessed at least
once within 30 days, your data is also deleted.

### Google Drive

You can sync devices using your own Google account. If each devices is logged into the same Google account, then Octi
can exchange information using Google drive.

Octi can only access it's own files on Google Drive.

Google Drive's privacy policy applies:

## Automatic crash reports

Anonymous device information may be collected in the event of an app crash or error.

To do this the app uses the service "Bugsnag":
https://www.bugsnag.com/

Bugsnag's privacy policy can be found here:
https://docs.bugsnag.com/legal/privacy-policy/

Crash reports may contain device and app related information, e.g. your phone model, Android version and app version.

You can disable automatic reports in the app's settings.
